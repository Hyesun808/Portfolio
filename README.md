This is exploratory data analysis on a year's worth of sales data from a fictitious pizza store.  
The raw data is available at https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground in 4 CSV files, and it includes the date and time of each order, pizza purchased, 
and additional details such as type, size, quantity, price, ingredients, and price of each pizza.
I used Microsoft SQL Server to conduct this exploratory data analysis.

This is exploratory data analysis on a year's worth of sales data from a fictitious pizza store.  
The raw data is available at Maven Analytics (https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground) in 4 CSV files, and it includes the date and time of each order, pizza purchased, and additional details such as type, size, quantity, price, ingredients, and price of each pizza.

Here is the data field discription provided with the data by Maven Analytics (downloadable at the same link)

I did this data analysis using Microsoft SQL Server.
